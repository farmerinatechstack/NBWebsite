            <h2>A Note From Our Team</h2>
            <p>We&apos;d love to meet you. Nature&apos;s Bounty Meats is owned and directed by a California farm family that is half-Lebanese, half-Honduran, and proudly American. Our team and customers represent many more cultures and global food traditions too.</p>
            <p>Our farm started in the 1990's. Our team embodies multiple cultures and we also appreciate global traditions beyond our own, so it was natural for us to start a custom meat farm. We have served 100&apos;s of California Bay Area families for 15+ years.</p>
            <p>Since Day 1, we've produced the purest-quality meats we've ever tasted (halal, standard meats, and more). Later, we expanded to help families with international roots to continue celebrating their meat and food heritage. Today, you can call us to get meats for anything from enjoying an exceptional BBQ (one of our favorites) to getting a first new experience with global meat traditions.</p>
